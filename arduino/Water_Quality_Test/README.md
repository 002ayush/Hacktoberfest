# Team Bitcoders Robothon 2020 Project
Official submission of team Bitcoders, the winners of Robothon 2020 NIT Raipur.

## About
A water quality index solution to find the quality of water of rivers in remote areas. 

## IoT :

We are using Arduino Uno microcontroller board to send water quality index stats to the display device via WiFi.

### The components used :

* Arduino Uno
* Temperature Sensor
* TDS Sensor
* NOx Sensor
* Wifi Module
* Jumper Wires
* USB Cable
* Arduino IDE (to upload program to the board)

You can download the Arduino IDE from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

### Steps :

1. Connect the IoT components.
2. Download and install arduino ide.
3. Copy the source code from IoT folder.
4. Connect the arduino to PC via usb cable.
5. Compile and upload the code to the board.
6. Open the ide console to view the output values.
7. Connect your device (app/web) to the WiFi of our system.
8. Voila! You have the water quality stats on your device.
